                <h4>A HISTORY OF PRESTON</h4>
                <p class="author-article">By Tim Lambert</p><br/>
                <p>Preston began as a village. It was called Priestâ€™s tun, which means a priestâ€™s farm or estate. In the 12th century, it grew into a town. 
                  This was partly because of its position. Firstly Preston is on a river. In those days it was much cheaper to transport goods by water than by 
                  land so goods could be easily transported to and from Preston. Preston was also the first place inland where the river could be bridged so a great 
                  deal of traffic passed through the area.<br>Preston was also on the main road from northern to southern England. Many people passed through the town and spend money there. In 1179 Preston was given a charter. 
                  (A charter was a document giving the townspeople certain rights).<br>Medieval Preston may have had about 1,500 inhabitants and about half a dozen streets. It would seem very small to us but towns were very
                  small in those days. By the standards of the time, Preston was a fair-sized market town. Though Preston was too small to have stone walls it did have stone gates, where tolls could be charged on goods 
                  entering the town. By the 12th century, Preston had a weekly market. From the 13th century, it also had a fair. In the Middle, Ages fairs were like markets but they were held only once a year for a 
                  period of several days. People would come from all over Lancashire to buy and sell at a Preston fair. <br>In the Middle Ages, there was a leper hospital just outside Preston. It was dedicated to
                  St Mary Magdalene. About 1260 the Franciscan friars arrived in Preston. The friars were like monks but instead of withdrawing from the world they went out to preach and to help the poor and the sick.
            
                  Franciscan friars were called grey friars because of their grey habits. Furthermore, by the 14th century, there was a grammar school in Preston.
